**Prediction of Huntington's disease**


---

Huntington's disease (HD) is a rare, inherited disease that causes progressive neurodegeneration​

Preferential loss of indirect pathway neurons in the Basal Ganglia leading to choreiform movements in HD

**Incidence:** 2.7 cases per 100,000 globally (5.7 per 100,000 in Europe, North America, Australia) ​

**Methods:**   


*   Characterized population and distribution of nuclei volumes​

*   Normalized volumes to patients without HD​

*   Compared nuclei volume using t-tests​
*   Implemented simple random forest ​ using features like Age, sex, nuclei volumes to predict HD diagnosis​

*   Built variable importance plot​
*  No normality assumption, risk of overfitting
